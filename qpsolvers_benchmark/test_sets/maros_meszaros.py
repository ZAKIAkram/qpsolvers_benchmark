## Success rate

Precentage of problems each solver is able to solve:

{success_rate_table}

Rows are solvers and columns are solver settings.

## Computation time

We compare solver computation times using the shifted geometric mean.

**Intuition:** a solver with a shifted geometric mean of Y is Y times slower
than the best solver over the test set.

### Details

There is a different ranking of solver runtimes for each problem in the test
set. To aggregate those rankings into a single metric over the whole test set,
we use the shifted geometric mean, which is a standard in [benchmarks for
optimization software](http://plato.asu.edu/bench.html).

The shifted geometric mean is a slowdown factor compared to the best solver
over the whole test set. It has the advantage of being compromised by neither
large outliers (as opposed to the arithmetic mean) nor by small outliers (in
contrast to the geometric geometric mean). The best solvers have a shifted
geometric mean close to one:

### Results
