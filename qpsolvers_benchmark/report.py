## Solvers

{self.get_solver_versions_table()}

All solvers were called via
[qpsolvers](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers) v{qpsolvers_version}.

## Settings

- Cost tolerance: {self.test_set.cost_tolerance}
- Primal tolerance: {self.test_set.primal_tolerance}
- Time limit: {self.test_set.time_limit} seconds

{self.get_solver_settings_table()}

## Metrics

We look at the following statistics:

- [Success rate](#success-rate)
- [Computation time](#computation-time)
- [Primal error](#primal-error)
- [Cost error](#cost-error)

They are presented in more detail in [Metrics](README.md#metrics).

## Results

### Success rate

Precentage of problems each solver is able to solve:

{success_rate_table}

Rows are [solvers](#solvers) and columns are [settings](#settings). We consider
that a solver successfully solved a problem when (1) it returned with a success
status and (2) its solution is within cost and primal error
[tolerances](#settings). Here is a summary of the frequency at which solvers
returned success (1) but the corresponding solution did not pass tolerance
checks:

{solve_is_success_table}

### Computation time

We compare solver computation times over the whole test set using the shifted
geometric mean. Intuitively, a solver with a shifted-geometric-mean runtime of
Y is Y times slower than the best solver over the test set. See
[Metrics](README.md#metrics) for details.

Shifted geometric mean of solver computation times (1.0 is the best):

{self.results.build_shifted_geometric_mean_df(
    column="runtime",
    shift=10.0,
    not_found_value=self.test_set.time_limit,
).to_markdown(index=True, floatfmt=".1f")}

Rows are solvers and columns are solver settings. The shift is $sh = 10$. As in
the OSQP and ProxQP benchmarks, we assume a solver's run time is at the time
limit when it fails to solve a problem.

### Primal error

The primal error measures the maximum (equality and inequality) constraint
violation in the solution returned by a solver. We use the shifted geometric
mean to compare solver primal errors over the whole test set. Intuitively, a
solver with a shifted-geometric-mean primal error of Y is Y times less precise
on constraints than the best solver over the test set. See
[Metrics](README.md#metrics) for details.

Shifted geometric means of solver primal errors (1.0 is the best):

{self.results.build_shifted_geometric_mean_df(
    column="primal_error",
    shift=10.0,
    not_found_value=self.test_set.primal_tolerance,
).to_markdown(index=True, floatfmt=".1f")}

Rows are solvers and columns are solver settings. The shift is $sh = 10$. A
solver that fails to find a solution receives a primal error equal to the
[primal tolerance](#settings).

### Cost errors

The cost error measures the difference between the known optimal objective and
the objective at the solution returned by a solver. We use the shifted
geometric mean to compare solver cost errors over the whole test set.
Intuitively, a solver with a shifted-geometric-mean cost error of Y is Y times
less precise on the optimal cost than the best solver over the test set. See
[Metrics](README.md#metrics) for details.

Shifted geometric means of solver cost errors (1.0 is the best):

{self.results.build_shifted_geometric_mean_df(
    column="cost_error",
    shift=10.0,
    not_found_value=self.test_set.cost_tolerance,
).to_markdown(index=True, floatfmt=".1f")}

Rows are solvers and columns are solver settings. The shift is $sh = 10$. A
solver that fails to find a solution receives a cost error equal to the [cost
tolerance](#settings).
